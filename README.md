# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining
## Homework 1
### Eduardo Baldo Chamorro

In this github you'll find 3 files.

The first one a pdf with all the submissions created on hackerrank [Hackerrank submissions Eduardo Baldo.pdf]([https://www.google.com](https://github.com/edduardobaldo/Homework-1-ADM-Eduardo-Baldo/blob/main/Hackerrank%20submissions%20Eduardo%20Baldo.pdf)) . With a total of 15 pages of submissions.

The second document is the important one [Homework-1-Eduardo-Baldo.ipnyb]([https://github.com/edduardobaldo/Homework-1-ADM-Eduardo-Baldo/blob/main/Homework%201%20AMDM%20Eduardo%20Baldo.ipynb]), here all the codes are ordered following this steps.

First the title of the problem, followed by the link of the solving problem(s). Then for each link it'll be said how many problems are unsolved, tried and solved.
If one link has more than 1 subproblems then the title of the subproblem will be writted on top of the code, if not only the link will be showned.

For the 3rd one is the GRades of the AWS Modules. I uploaded one day after the submission date because I just notice the grades weren't showned eventhought I already did it weeks before. So to make sure now I decided to upload the grades to the github.
